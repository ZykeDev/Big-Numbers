# Big Numbers
A Big type for Unity.
I needed a `Big` type to handle large numbers in an [incremental game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game), so I made this package. Handles numbers from a min of `1.0` up to a max of `9.999e+4294967295`. Does not handle negative values.

Can be installed via the Package Manager from the Git URL `https://github.com/ZykeDev/Big.git`.

Feel free to open an Issue if something doesn't work or for feature requests.
